 Psalm 91
1
He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. [1]
2
I will say [2] of the LORD, "He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust."
3
Surely he will save you from the fowler's snare and from the deadly pestilence.
4
He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.
5
You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day,
6
nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday.
7
A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.
8
You will only observe with your eyes and see the punishment of the wicked.
9
If you make the Most High your dwelling-- even the LORD, who is my refuge--
10
then no harm will befall you, no disaster will come near your tent.
